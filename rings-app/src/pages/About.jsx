            <em>
              Allowing to learn by discovering things [shapes] themselves and
              learning from their own experiences rather than by telling them
              things

          <h3>It is a collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            Liquid Candy takes care of manufacturing. MassMess is programming
            the weird shapes and the weird website.
          </p>
          <h3>It is all hand-made</h3>
          <p>
            One shapes material with hands (in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland). Another shapes
            algorithms with hands (in Barcelona, Spain).

          <h3>Experiment to wear</h3>
          <p>Once, we just imagined things differently. And we just did it.</p>
