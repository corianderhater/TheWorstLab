          <p>
            It is inifinite search for forms hidden in numeric complexities.
            Soldification of ephemeral algorithms and making them wearable is a
            part of the plan. Trying and failing is the base for every idea.
            Hundreds of lines of code, and hundreds of simulations are run
            before the final shape that you see on the screen, and can actually
            wear. Personal intuition bonds with curiosity to push myself, and
            the design a bit further.

            <em>
              Allowing to learn by discovering things [shapes] themselves and
              learning from their own experiences rather than by telling them
              things.

            takes care of manufacturing. MassMess is programming the weird
            shapes and the weird website.

            One shapes material with hands (in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland). Another shapes
            algorithms with hands (in Barcelona, Spain).
